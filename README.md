# 👋 Hi, I'm Le Gia Minh (Jia Ming) — aka the grade 10ner

I'm a grade 10 engineer, systems designer, and builder of deeply technical projects — ranging from high-fidelity aviation datasets to LLM-integrated VTuber systems. I build from the ground up and speak fluent math, code, and obsession.

## 🚀 What I Build

### 🛫 Aircraft Dataset Architect  
**SkyLab Hub** – An ultra-detailed, community-driven JSON aircraft dataset  
- 200+ aircraft with variant-level specs, engine configs, and imagery  
- Built manually over 6 months  
- Designed for aerospace modeling, fair exams, enthusiast tools, and education  
- Lightweight version available; full version supports full aircraft diff



---

### 🧠 LLM & AI Systems Developer  
**HouHouLLM** – A modular LLM-VTuber & system orchestrator  
- Runs local and Gemini-based models in unified CoE architecture  
- Custom sparse-activation framework for efficient task switching  
- Supports real-time Discord, Twitch, YouTube interactions  
- Handles reminders, DMs, mood-based animations, and knowledge recall  
- Powered by a 137B expert model, scaling toward 300B unified interactions

---

### 🛠 Infra & UI Hacker  
- Built full-stack tools like **SkyLab UI** for aircraft comparison  
- Designed scalable APIs to modularize AI behaviors  
- Multi-monitor setups, VS Code-first workflows, and zero bloat  
- Deep understanding of systems, from GPU memory loads to UI pixel alignment

## 📚 What Drives Me

I care about precision. Whether it’s the correct fan diameter of a GE90 engine or how long an LLM takes to respond to human tone, I go deep. I don’t flex — I ship. I stay quiet until pushed, and when I do speak, it’s code, visuals, or results.

## 🔧 Stack & Tools

- **Languages:** Python, JavaScript, JSON Schema, Bash  
- **Frameworks:** FastAPI, Next.js, Tailwind, Node.js, TensorFlow (low-level ops), PyTorch  
- **LLM Infra:** Custom CoE, context weighting w/ decay, task queues, prompt routing  
- **Setup:** Dual-screen, custom keyboard, VS Code terminal workflow, no distractions

## 🧭 Ongoing

- Building modular datasets and live-integrated AI tools  
- Organizing knowledge, not just output  
- Preparing full-scale docs on LLMs, vector search, memory control, and more

## 🥇 Highlights

- 🔥 1K+ LinkedIn followers from real project drops  
- ✈️ Aircraft dataset used in mock aviation exams  
- 🎥 Created HouHou, a VTuber smarter than half the room
